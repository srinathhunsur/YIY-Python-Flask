Assignment 1: 
Book Store REST API (Beginner Level)
• Create a new Flask project and name the file app.py.
• Inside the program, create an in-memory list named books to store book records.
• Create a POST API /add_book that accepts a JSON body containing:
  o "title"
  o "author"
  o "price"
• When a book is added, the API must:
  o Generate an ID
  o Store the book as a dictionary
  o Return a JSON confirming the addition
• Create a GET API /books that returns the entire list of books in JSON format.
• Create a GET API /book/<id> that returns a single book record based on the ID.
• Create a DELETE API /book/<id> that removes a book from the list.
• Test all APIs using Postman (GET, POST, DELETE operations).




Assignment 2: Student Marks Calculator API (Medium Level)
• Create a file named marks_api.py using Flask.
• Create a list called students to temporarily store data.
• Create a POST API /add_marks that accepts JSON with:
  o "name"
  o "math"
  o "science"
  o "english"
• After receiving the data:
  o Calculate total marks (math + science + english)
  o Calculate average marks
  o Add total and average to the student record
• Create a GET API /students to return all student records along with total and average.
• Use Postman to test:
  o Adding a student
